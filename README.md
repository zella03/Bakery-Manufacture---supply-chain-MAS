<h1>Bakery Manufacture - supply chain multiagent system</h1>
The proposed project focuses on <b>multi-agent coordination and task division in a collaborative supply chain environment</b>. It simulates a bakery production system where multiple agents interact dynamically to complete orders efficiently. The system operates within a multi-agent framework, ensuring smooth workflow execution through structured communication and decision-making processes.
<br><br>
Project is implemented in <b>JadeScript</b> and the environment consists of 4 distinct agent types, each with specialized roles:
<ul>
  <li>Baker (4 instances): Responsible for preparing baked goods. Bakers follow recipes, request ingredients, and manage the baking process.</li>
  <li>Supplier (2 instances): Supplies ingredients to bakers upon request.</li>
  <li>Packer (1 instance): Packs baked goods into appropriate packaging and prepares them for delivery.</li>
  <li>Supervisor (2 instances): Oversees the process, assigns orders, ensures quality control, and facilitates workflow coordination.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>A workday is finished when all baked items are prepared, packed, and delivered to the supervisor.</b> The project demonstrates the importance of agent-based cooperation in supply chain management, ensuring efficiency, adaptability, and resilience in handling real-world manufacturing constraints.
